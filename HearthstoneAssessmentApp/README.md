## What could I improve primarily

1. Create backend and API for REST API calls and sync data
2. Add unit tests
3. Add localizable strings to support localization
etc.

## Why I picked current third party libs

1. Realm as fast and simple DB engine for saving and retrieving data
2. SDWebImage for async loading and caching images by url
3. ScalingCarousel for good UX/UI in centering CollectionView

And of course all these libs depends on situation if it's prototype or own product
