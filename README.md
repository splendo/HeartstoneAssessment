## Introduction

Hsiao here at Splendo is a very enthusiastic casual Hearthstone player. He is also a user of the KLM houses apps ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/klm-houses/id371664245?l=en&mt=8) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klm.mobile.houses&hl=en))

He wants you to build a web app that has similar UI/UX. Similar way to go from the grid view to detail view, and also being able to scroll through the detail views like a carousel (hint: download the Houses app and have a look at how it works) but he wants the app to show Hearthstone card images.

We have supplied you with a json file (`cards.json`) containing all the Heartstone cards currently available.

Hsiao is especially interested in the app showing `Legendary` cards with the `Deathrattle Mechanic`, below are examples of such cards:

```json
{
   "cardId": "FP1_014",
   "name": "Stalagg",
   "cardSet": "Naxxramas",
   "type": "Minion",
   "rarity": "Legendary",
   "cost": 5,
   "attack": 7,
   "health": 4,
   "text": "<b>Deathrattle:</b> If Feugen also died this game, summon Thaddius.",
   "flavor": "Stalagg want to write own flavor text.  \"STALAGG AWESOME!\"",
   "artist": "Dany Orizio",
   "collectible": true,
   "elite": true,
   "playerClass": "Neutral",
   "howToGet": "Unlocked in The Construct Quarter, in the Naxxramas adventure.",

   "locale": "enUS",
   "mechanics": [

     }
   ]
}
```

and

     {
       "name": "Deathrattle"
     }
   ]
}
```

## Assignment

You are free to choose the patterns and architectures to create this web app, the requirements are :

### Backend

* Create an API using a Java (plain java or Groovy/Kotlin) backend allowing you to get card information for at least legendary deathrattle cards
* The API should also support filtering based on relevant request parameters. Ideally, the API should enable the following, listed from easy to hard:
  * filter by least the following fields: `type`, `rarity`, `classes`, and `mechanics`
  * return sorted results (for example, alphabetically sorted), supporting both ascending and descending
  * (optional) return the results by pages (based on a page size request parameter), iterating over the pages are maintained by a cursor which is included in the response, this cursor is used in the subsequent request

### Web Application

* Create the web app using JavaScript. You can use either plain JavaScript or a Framework of your choice
* Show the card images in a grid like the houses app
* when user click on a grid item , navigate to the card detail view where you can display more information regarding the card ( what you would like to show and how is up to you ), when in detail view the navigation to the next and previous card should be the same as the Houses App
* The user should be able to set a card as favourite and this info should be persisted when the app closes, how to show cards that are tagged as favourites and how to persist that information is up to you


## What we would like to see

* Proper handling of asynchonous calls
* Clean code
* Relevant design patterns
* Javascript best practices
* UI should remain responsive during content loading
* Should you use 3rd party libraries and frameworks please motivate your choice
* Unit tests
* Writing the backend using Google AppEngine is a plus, but feel free to use Amazon AWS, Tomcat or anything you prefer for handling your API calls

## Finally

To submit your result, fork this repository. When you are satisfied with your result, create a Pull Request. Make sure your backend is up and running somewhere for the duration of the review and tell us in the comments where to find it.

Good Luck!
