# General remarks

The assignment talks about making a web app, since I'm an iOS developer I assume I needed it to implement it as an native iOS app.

I did not make a back end for this assignment.

The assignments mentions a way to navigate between the detail pages to the next and previous card, I could not find any of this behavior in the app.

#  External libraries

## AlamoFire 
used this third party library for web calls, it is widely used in many apps and for that is often a safe bet to use in basic apps.

## Frameworks folder
this folder contains some files from my own library to just simplify some code, these repositories are private and as such I copied in the code
